# Welcome to my GitHub! :wave:

## :pushpin: About me
I'm @a-zonato and I'm a **Physicist** (BSc degree), currently doing my specialization in ***Physics of Complex Systems*** (MSc degree). I have experience in working with data
and AI, especially in **Neural Networks** and **Machine Learning** algorithms. I enjoy working on projects regarding a *learning process* and *Finance*, trying to link both
worlds. In the near future I'd like to find myself working on applications of Machine Learning in **Financial Markets**.

## :computer: Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python (advanced), C++ (general);
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Tensorflow, PyTorch;
- **Tools:** GAMA, SQL, Jupyter Notebook, Conda

## :open_file_folder: Projects
| Project Name | Description | Languages |

| Number 1 | Cool Description | Python |
| Number 2 | Another cool Description | Python |

## :bulb: Working on
Currently I'm focused on the possibile applications of Machine Learning in Finance, a field where there is the need to gain some useful predictions
based on previous data, keeping in mind that markets are extremely volatile and irrational decisions are taken everyday.
